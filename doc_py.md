# Overview: shoretel_voicemail_backup.py
Each ShoreTel voicemail has two components:
- the WAV file: This is the actual audio.
- the MSG file: This is what you receive in Communicator, informing you that you have a message. The MSG file contains information about the voicemail, like the Caller ID, which we want.

You will only have either a WAV **AND** MSG, or only a MSG.

The `check_path` function is run against each required directory, and will:
- check if the directory on HQ/DVS is accessible.
  - if not:
    - inform user that the directory is inaccessible.
    - exit with exit code `10`.
  - if an unknown error occurs:
    - inform user, then exit with exit code `20`.
  - if so:
    - silently continue

The `check_argument` function will:
- try to assign a passed argument to `ext`, then return `ext`
- if there is no argument:
  - inform user, then exit with exit code `30`.
- if the argument is a non-integer:
  - inform user, then exit with exit code `40`.
- if an unknown error occurs:
  - inform user, then exit with exit code `50`.

The `check_extension` function will:
- check HQ/DVS for the voicemail directory of the provided extension
  - if found:
    - inform user, then continue
  - if not found:
    - inform user, then exit with exit code `60`.

The `check_message_ids` function will:
- take the list of Message IDs generated by the `pstrings` function
- Count the Message IDs (for the voicemails) for the provided extension
  - if there are none:
    - inform user, then exit with exit code `70`.
  - if there are some:
    - try and make a directory, named with the current date and time, and the provided extension, on your Desktop
      - if successful:
        - inform user, then continue
      - if unsuccessful:
        - due to a directory with the same name already present:
          - inform user, then exit with exit code `80`.
        - due to an unknown error:
          - inform user, then exit with exit code `90`

The `backup_voicemails` function will:
- run a `for loop` against the list of Message IDs:
  - if the associated WAV from HQ/DVS is found:
    - inform the user and attempt to copy it to the directory on your Desktop
      - if copying is successful
        - copy it to the directory on your Desktop
        - attempt to rename the WAV _on your computer_ to:
          - the timestamp when the voicemail was left, and append
          - the Caller ID, if available
          - e.g. *"2017-1026_130203_+18883222822.wav"*
        - if renaming is unsuccessful:
          - inform the user, then continue
      - if copying is unsuccessful:
        - inform the user, then continue
  - if the associated WAV from HQ/DVS is found:
    - inform the user, then continue
